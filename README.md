### 🧩 Microservices Overview

| Service           | Language | DB/Protocol         | Description |
|------------------|----------|---------------------|-------------|
| **ProductService** | Go       | MongoDB + gRPC      | Stores product data and communicates with RabbitMQ to forward new product data. |
| **UserService**    | C# (.NET) | PostgreSQL + REST   | Handles user authentication, shopping list creation, and history tracking. |
| **SearchService**  | Python   | Pinecone + REST     | Generates product embeddings and performs semantic search. |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker

### Environment Setup

Before starting the app, copy and customize `.env.example` files for each service:

```bash
cp ProductService/.env.example ProductService/.env
cp UserService/UserService/.env.example UserService/UserService/.env
cp SearchService/.env.example SearchService/.env
cp AuditService/.env.example AuditService/.env
cp ShopScraper/.env.example ShopScraper/.env
cp micro-frontends/mfe-search/.env.example micro-frontends/mfe-search/.env
cp micro-frontends/mfe-user/.env.example micro-frontends/mfe-user/.env
cp micro-frontends/shell/.env.example micro-frontends/shell/.env
cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env
```

Edit each `.env` file and provide valid values.

> ℹ️ **Note:** All services use `.env` files for configuration such as database URLs, ports, API keys, and secret keys. Ensure these are correctly set before running the application.

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DavidBalazic/SmartShopperApp.git
